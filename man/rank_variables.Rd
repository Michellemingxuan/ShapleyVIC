\usage{
rank_variables(
  model_id,
  val,
  val_sd = NULL,
  var_names = NULL,
  summarise = FALSE,
  ties.method = "min"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_id}{A vector of model ID.}

\item{val}{A numeric vector of model reliance from each model.}

\item{val_sd}{A numeric vector of standard deviations of model reliance (with
the same length as \code{val}), if available.}

\item{var_names}{A factor or string vector of variable names (with the same
length as \code{val}). If unspecified, variables will be named 'X1', 'X2', etc.}

\item{summarise}{If \code{TRUE}, ranks will be summarised across models by
taking the numeric average. Default is \code{FALSE}, where ranks for
individual models will be returned.}

\item{ties.method}{How to handle tied ranks. Default is \code{"min"}. See
\code{\link{rank}}.}
}
\value{
Returns an integer vector of ranks of variables for each model (in
  descending order). Model reliance (possibly with 95\% confidence interval)
  is compared between all possible pairs of variables. Variables with model
  reliance significantly than the other variable in more pairwise comparisons
  are ranked higher.
