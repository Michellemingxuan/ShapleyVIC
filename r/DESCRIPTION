Description: A novel variable importance method that analyses a cloud of nearly 
    optimal models using Shapley-based method for comprehensive and robust 
    assessments. The resulting Shapley variable importance cloud pools 
    information across models to provide an overall importance measure, with 
    uncertainty explicitly quantified to support formal statistical inference. 
    We provide visualizations to highlight the uncertainty and facilitate 
    communication of findings. The details are described in our research 
    paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2022.100452>.
